Are there bad code?

There might be so I am posting this for reference in the future.

It is hard for every beginner to code well, but I am pretty sure the code will be better(I also hope I would be).

Line 5 and 6 in the image show how I solved the quiz.

There is always better code so I should keep learning and coding.
