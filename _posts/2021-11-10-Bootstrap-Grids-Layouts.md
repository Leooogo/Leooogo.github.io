Modal Windows
A modal window is a secondary window that opens on top of the main one. Users have to interact with it before they can carry out their task and return to the main window.

The use case of a dropdown is giving a quick access to several options (7 to 15) hidden that lighten design.

In General, Avoid Drop-Downs When There Are More Than 10 or Fewer Than 5 Options
Drop-downs quickly become difficult for users when they are presented with an overwhelming number of options to choose from.

What are the three Bootstrap CSS classes you have to know to design a grid?
•	container
•	row
•	col

✨✨✨✨✨
Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system. Conatiners are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them.
.container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
.container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints
.container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint

Use the reponsive .row-cols-* classes to quickly set the number of columns that best render your content and layout.

Columns build on the grid’s flexbox architecture. Flexbox means we have options for changing individual columns and modifying groups of columns at the row level.
When building grid layouts, all content goes in columns. The hierarchy of Bootstrap’s grid goes from container to row to column to your content. 
Bootstrap includes predefined classes for creating fast, responsive layouts. With six breakpoints and a dozen columns at each grid tier, we have dozens of classes already built for you to create your desired layouts. This can be disabled via Sass if you wish.

The use case of a popover is giving additional information when the user clicks on an item. It appears on top of other elements.

What are the key words associated to size screen in the Bootstrap grid?
•	col- (extra small) for smartphones
•	col-sm- (small) for tablets
•	col-md- (medium) for laptops
•	col-lg- (large) for desk screen
•	col-xl- (extra large) for screens >= 1200px
Note that last 13' retina screen definition is so high that it matches lg format.

✨✨✨✨✨
Utilize breakpoint-specific column classes for easy column sizing without an explicit numbered class like .col-sm-6
