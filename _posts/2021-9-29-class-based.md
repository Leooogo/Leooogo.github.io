![challenge](/images/2021-9-28.png)

I have solved some coding challenges yesterday.

I am posting one of them.

I thought the solution of this challenge was little complicated, but it was not.

Anyhow I also solved it so I just want to compare mine and the lecture.

I sometimes need to think something simply.

I hope this post would be helpful to not only me but also other people.
