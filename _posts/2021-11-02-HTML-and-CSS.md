I'm planning to write some concept about frontend things.

Today's topic is some basic information about HTML and CSS.

<br>
Describe the role of HTML, CSS & JS in front-end development.
- HTML: content and structure
- CSS: style
- JS: dynamism and usability

Standard CSS selectors are HTML tags, CSS classes or CSS ids.

The four types of CSS units can be absolute in px, relative to the parent element in %, relative to the viewport(window) height vh or width vw, or relative to the font size of the element in em.

A CSS class is a HTML attribute used to define some re-usable CSS properties.

A CSS id is an HTML attribute used to define some CSS properties for a unique element.

The three languages your browser speaks are HTML, CSS & JavaScript

In the HTML skeleton, head markup contains metas which are read by the browser. body markup contains content which is displayed to the client by the browser.

  The HTML head is the contents of the <head> element - unlike the contents of the <body> elememt(which are displayed on the page when loaded in a browser), the head's content is not displayed on the page. Instead, the head's job is to contain metadata about the document. In the above example, the head is quite small:
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  In larger pages however, the head can get quite full.

Both the <title> & <meta name='description'> tags are basics for SEO, contents of those tags are read and displayed by Google in search results. So pay attention to write clear metas!
  
Box model defines css dimension properties of a HTML element, a <div> basically. CSS properties width and height manage box content dimensions, padding manages space between content and box borders, margin manages space around the box and border manages box borders dimensions.

  The padding CSS shorthand property sets the padding area on all four side of an element at once.
  An element's padding area is the space between its content and its border.
  It sets the values of padding-bottom, padding-left, padding-right, padding-top.
  
  The margin CSS shorthand property sets the margin area on all four sides of an element.
  It sets the values of margin-bottom, margin-left, margin-right, margin-top.
  
  The border shorthand CSS property sets an element's border. It sets the values of border-width, border-style, and border-color.
